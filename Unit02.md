**Unit 2: Creating a Block Style Business Letter** <span id="2"></span> 
*There are many styles of business letters.  Often the office manager
will manage styles.  In this unit, you will learn the basic block style
business letter used in many offices.  Pay particular attention to
spacing, as it is an important component of this style.*  
    
 *In the newer versions of MS Word (both 2007 & 2010), the*Normal
*style, which is the default when you open the program, automatically
creates a space after each paragraph.  We do **not** want to allow the
computer to automatically format this spacing as it is not set at proper
spacing for a business letter.*  *The spacing with* Normal *Style is
meant for on-screen spacing, not printed documents.*  *You will always
use the* No Spacing *style* *when creating letters for this unit.  This
will be shown in the video below (sub-subunit 2.1.3).*  
    
 *We will also discuss non-printing characters.  These are on-screen
characters that are viewed when the Show/Hide button (¶) is enabled (in
the Paragraph grouping on the Home ribbon).  These characters do not
print.  They allow a “background” view of the document to see if correct
spacing and other formatting techniques were used.  Here is a list of
three non-printing characters you will see and use in the following two
units:*  
    
 ¶ *   means the ENTER key was used.*  
 ·*     shows each time the Space Bar was used.*  
 **--\>**  *shows each time the TAB key was used.*  
    
 *These non-printing characters will be displayed in the example
documents in this unit that you can print out and keep close, but they
will not actually show on a printed document that you create.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 1.25 hours to complete.

        between paragraphs?

        enclosure included?
