Course Syllabus for "PRDV003: Word Processing Using Microsoft Word"
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This course is designed for the novice who has little or no word
processing experience.  The course provides an introduction to word
processing.  You will explore word processing skills while also learning
to create a basic business letter and a business memo.  Although the
resources in this course use Microsoft Word 2010, it should be noted
that all of the basic skills and tasks that you will be asked  can be
done on **any** word processing program.  If you stay flexible enough in
your own word processing program to search out the commands and icons on
whatever software you are using, you will succeed.  The most current
version of Microsoft Word was selected, because it would be most
beneficial to the job seeker.  In addition most colleges, universities,
and some public libraries are using a newer version of Word.  You can
complete this course using any word processing software, but if you are
using an older version of Word, you may also want to seek out a resource
where you can interact with the newer version after you have mastered
the information presented here. This course will introduce you to the
Home ribbon and File ribbon.  A “ribbon” is the new toolbar interface
introduced by Microsoft with its release of Office 2007.  Ribbons are
also called tabs.  Commands are now presented horizontally along the top
of the application window instead of from a drop-down menu.  The tools
within each ribbon are put into different “groupings” based on
functionality.  The grouping is often set off by a small line or border,
and the name of the grouping can be seen near the bottom of the ribbon.
 Some ribbons/tabs appear only when certain objects are used or
selected.  These ribbons pertain directly to that object only.  For
example, a Picture Tool Format ribbon will appear once a graphic has
been inserted through the Insert ribbon. The Home ribbon and the File
ribbon are the most commonly used.  You will work with these ribbons and
commands from the Font and Paragraph groupings to create a block style
business letter and a block style business memo.  You will also learn
how to add and delete commands from the Quick Access Toolbar that sits
above the ribbons at the very top left of the Word window.  This
horizontal toolbar is slightly different from a ribbon and is easy to
customize.
