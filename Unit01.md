**Unit 1: Introduction to Ribbons** <span id="1"></span> 
*In this unit, we will compare the 2007 Office Button to the 2010 File
Ribbon to see their similarities and slight differences.  This unit will
introduce ribbons in both programs.  We will also discuss how to save
and print a document from both of these programs.  This unit will
introduce you to the Quick Access Toolbar, and you will learn how to add
commands to and delete commands from the toolbar.*

**1.1 Menu Environment** <span id="1.1"></span>

    Example”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/PRDV003-1.1-Menu-versus-Ribbon-Examples-FINAL.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please click on the link above and study this example
    of a “menu environment.  Although we will be using a “ribbon”
    environment, the “menu” environment may be similar to what you are
    currently using.  All word processors contain the same commands;
    they may just be found in different places.  
        
     Studying this resource should take approximately 5 minutes.

**1.2 Office Button / File Ribbon** <span id="1.2"></span>

    Ribbon”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/PRDV003-1.2-OfficeButtonFileMenu-FINAL.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please click on the link above to access the PDF. 
    Compare the similarities between the two icons in the document.
     When Microsoft changed from “menus” to “ribbons” with the
    introduction of Office 2007, the old File Menu became the Office
    Button.  This confused many people who wanted to see the word “File”
    as in all previous versions of Word.  When Word 2010 was introduced,
    the Office Button had been replaced with the File ribbon similar to
    the old File menu that you saw above in 1.1.  
        
     Studying this resource should take approximately 5 minutes.
