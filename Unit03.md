**Unit 3: Creating a Block Style Business Memo** <span id="3"></span> 
*Businesses use many styles of business memos and templates.  In this
unit we will look at a basic block style business memo.  Of course, you
are encouraged to investigate other memo templates in your own word
processing program.*  
    
 *You will use font “styles” such as bold, italicize, and underline to
emphasize text.  This unit will also highlight the use of borders as a
visual break between sections of a memo.*  
    
 *Iit may be more likely in a memo that a “CC” will need to be included.
 CC means Carbon Copy and refers to an old practice where a piece of
carbon paper is put between two pieces of paper while a document is
written to create a copy of the document.  Nowadays, to CC someone means
to send a copy of the original document to that person.  Today, a CC is
most commonly used with email.  This unit will explain the use of CC in
memos. *

    attempted it on your own first.

    memo:  

    -   Is the word MEMO centered on the top with a space underneath?
    -   Are the heading words to, from, date, and subject capitalized
        and bolded, but not the information following the heading words?
    -   Was the TAB key used to line up all information after the
        heading words?
    -   Is the spacing correct?
    -   Is there a line separating the top heading information from the
        body of the text?
    -   Are the typist’s initials there? 

    Creating this memo should take approximately 15 minutes.
